     <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
     <p>I am currently a university student in my third year studying Business Information and Technology at Jomo Kenyatta university of Agriculture and Technology(JKUAT).I decided to take an academic break to join <em>moringa school</em>to study programming and coding as the level and method of teaching used in JKUAT is very poor.A week in Moringa is greater than four years in JKUAT.I also joined Moringa more so to quench my thirst for programming and coding and achieve the dream of being a world class developer.My interest other than programming are sports..I am skilled in the field of art being a great designer myself.I love watching and participating in sports of all kinds :
     <ol>
        <li>Soccer</li>
        <li>Rugby</li>
        <li>Tennis</li>
     </ol>
